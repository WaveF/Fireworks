#Duplicate, Rotate and Offset Panel for Fireworks
A cool little extension for creating duplicate objects, Duplicate, Offset, and Rotate will automatically 
create duplicates of objects and arrange them in a variety of ways. For those times when you need to make 
something like a grid, or just create a line of small squares or circles, this one is a winner. 
You can even choose to animate the copied objects by accessing the options for the extension and 
choosing to distribute to frames. Here you see how easy it was to create a grid shape by drawing one rectangle, 
setting it to duplicate at 180 degrees and offset the objects 2 pixels from each other.
